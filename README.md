# DiscordTriviaBotGit
My first computer science project.
This is my first discord bot and my first project in JavaScript.
This project helped me learn the basics of JavaScript as well as how to utilize libraries.

Currently hosted via Heroku

Helped me learn the basics of JS as well as the NodeJS library. 
Also taught me how to read documentation via the DiscordJS API.
Also taught me how to use GitHub and how to host code online via Heroku. 
The actual source code that is in use has a dictionary with sensitive information, so the provided repository has the dictionary omitted.
